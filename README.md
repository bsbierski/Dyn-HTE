# Dyn-HTE (post-processing)
High temperature expansion of dynamic Matsubara spin correlators for general Heisenberg models (only post-processing)

* **Embedding:**  Calculation of embedding factor for graphG g_n

* **ConvenienceFunctions:**  Definition of various functions to help evaluate and plot the results of the Dyn-HSE

* **LatticeGraphs** Adds implementations for different lattices like square,triangle,... can be expanded by user.
