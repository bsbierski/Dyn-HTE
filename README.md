# Dyn-HTE (post-processing)
High temperature expansion of dynamic Matsubara spin correlators for general Heisenberg models (only post-processing)

* **LatticeGraphs** Generates lattices or lattice balls by keyword geometry=chain,square,triangle,... (can be expanded by user). The site indices of the center unit-cell of the lattice ball are returned. This code builds on Lattice.jl which is taken from SpinMC.jl

* **Embedding:**  Calculation of embedding factor for graphG g_n

* **ConvenienceFunctions:**  Definition of various functions to help evaluate and plot the results of the Dyn-HSE
